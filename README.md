Feature selection is a very hot topic in machine learning and data mining. It allows to reduce the dimensionality of a problem which is needed to learn appropriate models and reduce the volume of the data. It also allows us to identify relevant features and even establish a ranking of features (very interesting in bioinformatics). There are many approaches to select/rank features: filter, wrapper, and embedded feature selection (e.g. implicit selection performed by a RandomForest). In big data, there are some solutions to deal with this, which are mostly focused on filter approaches and univariate models (because they are faster). In this project, you should investigate different feature selection approaches in the context of Big Data with a high number of features. In your expression of interest, you should indicate the kind of approaches you will focus on and if your target is to reduce the dimensionality or determine a ranking of features.
